# Minutemizer

A package to support **Minutemen** project

It is used to add, store, delete a list of minutemen and generate a random one. 
It shall hide the way of storing the list. 
The sorage could be anything -- plist file, UserDefaults data base, synced iCloud Drive, CoreData or anything else. 
So the goal is to provide a convenience API to handle the list of minutemen and to use it any way you like it, shall it be SwiftUI app, CLI tool or whatever

In future releases it is planed to add statistics functionality
